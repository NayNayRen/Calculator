## About My Lil' Calculator

Well, it's a calculator, and it's mine, I made it. It can perform some basic mathings. Current expression used will display above the calculator once evaluated. The result will display on the output screen. Empty submissions or invalid basic expressions will display an error in the ouput screen.
